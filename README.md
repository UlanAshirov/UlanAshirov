### Hi, my name's Ulan and I am an Android developer üëã

I write in Kotlin and Java. I always adhere to the principles of OOP programming and make sure that my code fits SOLID! To work with the network, I use Retrofit and OkHttp, and to control the versions of my libraries I use the Version Catalog. Currently studying Jetpack Compose and Compose Kotlin multiplatform for cross-platform development

I completed an internship at GeekStudio, where I learned to write clean code using Functional Multimodularity in conjunction with a Clean Architecture. During my internship, I developed a dictionary application and an application for searching for designers and design companies, Style Scope!
I was responsible for developing the application architecture and implementing functions such as pagination, search, filtering, profile editing, and also conducted code reviews for other internship participants.
I took part in startups such as AutoPro. It was an app for selling cars.

- üî≠ Currently I work at the company Decks, where I developing an application for learning new foreign words

- üå± I am currently studying at the Ural Federal University as a process engineer

- ‚ö° Fun fact:
When I was working on the Style Scope project, we did not have time to deliver the project on time and there was a lot of dirt in the code. And then in 24 hours I completely rewrote the entire project from scratch, rebuilt the architecture, reduced the code using SOLID principles. Thanks to this, we successfully passed the project and defended ourselves at the presentation
